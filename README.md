	[TR] Tugas Revolution IRC Bot | http://s1.zetaboards.com/Tugas_Revolution/ , #tugas_revolution
	Created by Sael @ZETTCA Â© 2008-2009
	
	
	This mIRC Script was created in order to facilitate the clan's stuff.
	Contains stuff to set/warn events, count/highlight, NS/CS/mode shortcuts, etc.
	
	No abstractions were used at that time, so you'll have to change pretty much every line.
